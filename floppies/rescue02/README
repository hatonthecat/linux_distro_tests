This is a Linux rescue floppy. It will allow you to boot to either
an existing linux partition or to a ram disk image contained on
this floppy. Thank to the excellent work of all the Linux kernel
hackers a lot more information can be squeezed on to one disk. And
thanks to the authors of lilo and the vfat file system you can boot
dos to the second hard drive and use Linux to back up Win95 partitions.

This floppy should work with ide and either adaptec 1542 or ncr53c7,8xx.
It can also be used as a starting point for your own recovery floppy.


To create a boot floppy you can use the command
cat kernel.img ramdisk.gz > /dev/fd0 
to a formatted 3 inch floppy. 

To create a boot floppy from dos you can use the command
copy /b kernel.img+ramdisk.gz image
and then use rawrite to write image to a floppy.	

For more information on the Linux ramdisk feature you can read the Linux 
kernel docs. It tells you how to make your own rescue floppy. You can 
modify ramdrive.gz by extracting it to /dev/ram and mounting it as an ext2
file system.
