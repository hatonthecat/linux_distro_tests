The battery never worked, as advertised, but I had an old 19V adapter for a netbook so I didn't have to spend extra money to get it working, and not frequent enough to want to have two 19V adapters for netbooks I barely use.  I was able to run [Crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) linux with Xfce for a while, but it got old and have been willing to risk a brick with a hardware root.

Enter Mr Chromebox (a coreboot):

I found the screw that it mentions:

Now I just need to install an OS.
